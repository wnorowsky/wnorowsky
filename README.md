- 👋 Greetings, I’m Wnorowsky, Nicolás! I'm 30 years old and i live in Córdoba, Argentina.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning real programming, on a day-to-day basis, in overcoming efforts in the most efficient way possible, meeting people along the way with the same drive and objective that motivates me to make myself known in this portfolio and create new friendships. Thanks for taking a little time out of your busy lives to read me!
- 🌱 I'm currently studying Systems Analyst at "Instituto Superior Santo Domingo" (http://issd.edu.ar/). Finishing first year in days!
- 💞️ Here on my first job search in the computer field. Obviously I have no experience in it, but I have a lot of excitement to put everything I learned to the test and discover what is yet to come.
